Copy-Pasting something from outside, into the Git-Bash can cause some problems.

Problem (Windows): "Ctrl-C -> Ctrl-V" doens't work.

Solution 1:

One possible solution is the key Insert (Ins).
When copy-pasting something from outside, in a lap-top keyboard, make sure the the "Num Lock" button is off.
Then press "Ctrl" + "Ins" to copy, and "Shift" + "Ins" to paste.

This can bring some other problems because it might insert invisible characters that will disturb the command lines.

Solution 2:

Do everything with the mouse. 
Select the text and, if needed, right click on it and press copy.
Go to the Git Bash, right click on it and press paste.
